First of all, CodeUtilities requires Fabric Loader to run!

**How to install Fabric Loader**
1. Download Fabric Installer from official Fabric website: https://fabricmc.net/use/
2. Run the installer and select Minecraft version you want to use, and install it
3. Open Minecraft Launcher and run Fabric that you installed, similar to Forge.
4. Once you got to the title screen, close Minecraft.  
   After you launch Fabric for the first time, the `mods` folder should be created in your `%appdata%\.minecraft`.
5. For most Fabric mods, you have to install Fabric API separately. (including CodeUtilities)  
   Download Fabric API for your Minecraft version from here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api  
   and put the Fabric API jar file in your `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods`.
6. Since Fabric does not have Mod List menu like in Forge, it is recommended to install another Fabric mod called Mod Menu: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu
7. Setup done! If you didn't understand how to install Fabric, look at official installing instruction: https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install

After installing Fabric Loader and Fabric API, now download CodeUtilities from https://codeutilities.github.io/ and put it in the mod folder.  
Then join any Singleplayer world or Multiplayer server and try typing `/codeutilities` in your chat.  
If you have done everything correctly, the CodeUtilities command list should show up.

Now you can use CodeUtilities freely. Head to DiamondFire and have fun!
