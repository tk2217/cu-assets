You are able to use optifine on fabric if you have  Optifabric https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric !
Make sure to put optifabric and optifine mods in your `mods` folder.

**Notes**
In some cases optifine is known to break compatibility with other mods. For better compatibility and performance see Sodium https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium which supports fabric natively.
